# Implementation-of-Logistic-Regression-Using-Gradient-Descent

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the the Logistic Regression Using Gradient Descent.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Initialize Parameters: Set initial values for the weights (w) and bias (b).
2. Compute Predictions: Calculate the predicted probabilities using the logistic function.
3. Compute Gradient: Compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to w and b.
4. Update Parameters: Update the weights and bias using the gradient descent update rule. Repeat steps 2-4 until convergence or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

## Program:
